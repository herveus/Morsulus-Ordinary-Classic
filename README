Morsulus-Ordinary-Classic

This provides a database schema and ORM for an ordinary database that 
closely resembles the classic flat file format, adapted to a relational
model. It also provides support for translating to and from the legacy
flat file format.

Utilities include loading, dumping, and editing a database.

DBIx::Class underlies the schema.
